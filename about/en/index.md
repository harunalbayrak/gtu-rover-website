  title: Who are we?
  p1: Gebze Technical University was established on November 4, 2014, on the foundations and experience of Gebze High Technology Institute, which was established in 1992, and protecting its 22-year heritage. Our university is the youngest yet experienced university, which is a candidate to be the most important science base of our country with its infrastructure, equipment and academic staff.
  p2: GTU Rover Team was founded in May 2020 and is a young, dynamic team with 30+ members who are interested in Space, Science and Technology. It was founded by students from different disciplines in order to produce robotic solutions to the problems of the future in extraterrestrial and interplanetary missions.
  p3: "Our team consists of 5 different sub-teams: Electronics, Software, Mechanics, Science, Sponsorship & Media. The duties of the sub-teams are as follows;"
teams:
  software:
    title: Software Team
    text1: Team develops algorithms using data from sensors and cameras to enable the rover and the robot arm to move autonomously.  
    text2: Team designs an interface to control the rover and visualize the data from the rover.  
    text3: Team enables the rover to recognize objects around it by using image processing techniques. 
  electronics:
    title: Electronics Team
    text: Team provides the necessary power to electronic components on the Rover, in-vehicle communication and wireless communication with the ground station, designs and manufactures PCBs.
  science: 
    title: Science Team
    text: Team analyzes the samples that Rover has taken from the competition area and look for any signs of life that may have happened in the past or in the future. They are also responsible for examining the geological structure of the competition area.
  sponsorship:
    title: Sponsorship and Media Team
    text: Team is responsible for providing sponsorship by negotiating with companies, sharing posts about the team on social media platforms to announce the team to wider audiences, and creating content by making designs for the promotion of the team.

  mechanical:
    title: Mechanical Team
    text1: Team is responsible for designing the drive system, robotic arm and soil sampling platform for science missions, including parts of the rover such as chassis, suspension and wheels, as well as for its production and for testing its ability to perform Roverâ€™s missions under extreme conditions in accordance with the parameters of the competition.
    text2: Our purpose is to design and produce a robot that fits the parameters of the URC/ERC competitions as well as to play a leading role in training the next generation of multidisciplinary, devoted engineers and increasing innovation in the world of education and research in our region.
